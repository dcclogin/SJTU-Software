- Background

There are more than 20,000 biobricks in iGEM official standard database and the number mounts every year. With the explosive increase of biobricks, it will be tough for synthetic biologists to manually find suitable biobricks which meet the requirements when they try to create new devices with existing parts. This issue inevitably leads to creations of software and databases related to synthetic biology and these intelligent tools will further promote the rapid development of synthetic biology. Thus, we integrated biobricks data from the iGEM official standard database and then created an online device-designing system for synthetic biology researchers.

Meanwhile, after our project iMAP in 2016, we have surveyed and noticed that the instant messaging function we developed in 2016 could hardly replace existing ones such as QQ/Wechat, LINE and WhatsApp, besides, not everyone got used to sending instant messages for academic communication. Instead, emails, or a platform like Quora was more suitable for knowledge and information exchange. So we developed a new function called Q&A, a Quora in synthetic biology field.
